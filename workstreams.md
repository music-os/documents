# Motivation

As neume grows and an increasing number of developers, projects, and explorers become interested in its potential, there is a need to delineate the core focus of neume development.

This document is intended to be "live" and updated regularly as neume develops. It is based on inputs from the community, predominantly via the open office calls.

The intention is that this document can be used as a guide for focus of neume development, to enable contributors to specialise in certain areas of need, where they wish to, and to help with paid work proposals that may be more likely to gain support.

However, it is important to note that it should not be seen as a complete guide as to what work may be useful for neume development. In addition to our intention of developing this document as neume develops, we note that there may be some projects that do not fit neatly within the defined workstreams, but are still valuable research and experimentation.


# Workstreams

neume currently has four distinct areas of focus:

- **Architecture and maintenance**: Constant improvement of neume as we move towards a reliable and robust infrastructure
- **Music NFT expansion**: Horizontal expansion of the types of contracts that are ingested into neume
- **Ownership and identity**: Enabling cross-platform efforts around on-chain identity
- **Curation**: Enabling cross-platform efforts around curation
